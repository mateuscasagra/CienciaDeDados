# Product Overview

## Project Name
Detecção de Padrões Temporais em Acidentes Fatais (Temporal Pattern Detection in Fatal Accidents)

## Purpose
Statistical analysis system for identifying temporal patterns in fatal traffic accidents in Curitiba, PR, Brazil. The project analyzes accident data to identify critical hours, days, and months, along with associated factors (weather, road type, vehicle type) to reduce traffic fatalities.

## Key Deliverables
- Optimal inspection schedule (alcohol/speed enforcement)
- Ambulance and patrol prioritization based on temporal patterns
- Identification of critical locations and time periods
- Evidence-based insights for public safety policies

## Target Users
- Public safety managers and policymakers
- Traffic enforcement agencies
- Researchers in traffic safety and data science
- Academic institutions studying accident prevention

## Core Features
